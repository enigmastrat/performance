# performance
This is a continuous work in progress. Though, this was created for my daughter to document the choreography in her
dance routines, I found that it is fairly useful for taking and sharing notes in our worship band.

# Issues
* As of July 2023, this does not utilize any sort of persistence, so once the server is down, the data is gone... not optimal.
* No means for user creation except manual addition at the source code level... need to add that
* Music upload has no upload indicator, so it is hard to tell if your song is really uploading
* Only supports MP3 file format right now

# MVP goal
A web-based musical annotation tool that allows users to upload music, visualize the waveform, add annotations at different locations in a song, and share the work with others.
